        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am an individual who enjoys takickling whatever task is thrown my way. I am not someone who gives up easily but rather believe that there is always a solution and a way to work through anything as long as you are dedicated enough to do it. I am someone who thoroughly enjoys problem solving and applying my mind to anything, being puzzles, riddles or tasks. I am very ambitious and will always strive to give my best, no matter the challenge.</p>
